# XamarinForms-NetStandard-Project
Blank Xamarin.Forms Solutions with .NET standard library that's ready to build and run only on VS2017 (Earlier VS version will not able to open this due to usage of NuGet `PackageReference`)

This project is using [Xamarin.Forms 2.3.5.235-pre2](https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/93181/pre-release-xamarin-forms-2-3-5-235-pre2) as this **pre-release** version is compatible with .NET standard library.

Constructed using instructions from [Oren Novotny's blogpost](https://oren.codes/2017/04/23/using-xamarin-forms-with-net-standard-vs-2017-edition/)

## How do I use this?
* Download
* Rename projects/solutions/folder/file name as you see fit
* Open (with VS2017), build and run!

## Last known good build environment/tools
* Visual Studio 2017 v 15.1 (26403.7). Pre-VS2017 
* Xamarin 4.4.0.34 (3f99c5a)
* Xamarin.Android SDK 7.2.0.7 (b16fb82)
