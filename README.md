# XamarinForms-NetStandard
Blank Xamarin.Forms Solutions with .NET standard library that's ready to build and run only on VS2017, using instructions from [Oren Novotny's blogpost](https://oren.codes/2017/04/23/using-xamarin-forms-with-net-standard-vs-2017-edition/) . 

Each project referenced [Xamarin.Forms 2.3.5.235-pre2](https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/93181/pre-release-xamarin-forms-2-3-5-235-pre2) as it's compatible with .NET standard library. Exercise caution when using this in production environment.

**PS**: Earlier VS version will not able to open this due to usage of NuGet `PackageReference`, which is only supported in VS2017.
